creating a portfolio website


I’m Sagar Sudam Warfade, and this is my portfolio website, where I showcase my skills 
in web development and software engineering. With a strong foundation in both 
front-end and back-end technologies, I specialize in building visually engaging,
ser-friendly, and high-performance websites and applications. I work with 
technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more to create seamless
digital experiences. This portfolio features a selection of my projects that highlight
my passion for coding, attention to detail, and commitment to delivering quality 
solutions. I’m always excited to take on new challenges and bring innovative ideas to life online.
